The game ends in 3 cases
<br>
1. one of the teams reveals all its cards - it wins<br>
2. your opponents guess your last words<br>
3. one of the teams uncovers the killer (black card) - that team loses <br>
<br>
At the end of the game, a pop-up window shows who has won, and you can also see what the board looked like and whose cards were on which team.
Then, if you want, you can start a new game.
